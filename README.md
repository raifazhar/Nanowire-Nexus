Game Overview:
The summary of the game involves a brilliant scientist who used to work for a corrupt government-funded research facility. Upon understanding the corrupt morale of his peers and superiors, and willing to prevent creating a society bent on human enslavement, he quits his job and becomes a threat to the public eye. Using his nanobots, he must now venture back into his old workplace, and obtain as much information as he can. In the process, he aims to shut down the entire facility by any means necessary.
The theme of the game is retro-future. The game itself takes place in the 1960’s, a few decades before computers and wireless telephones became commonplace in homes & offices. As a large underground government-funded facility, the offices itself are much more advanced than any laboratories at the time. The recruitment of these scientists to perform unethical and shady experiments for information and research purposes is actually derived from a real life event, commonly known as ‘Operation Paperclip’, where the experiments the scientists performed in this game could be similar to that story in history. Additionally, it inspired the concept of the scientist to quit and stay hidden, and sending his inventions to work for him instead of handling it himself, since the underground facility existing leads to a large number of risks, such as being killed should they decide to leave or refuse orders, “for our country’s sake”.

Game Description:
In this game, the character plays as the nanobot, which is being controlled by the scientist who quit in the story. The nanobot is given a range of in-game abilities, such as climbing on all types of equipment and surfaces, such as tables, walls and air vents, as well as hacking into other electrical devices i.e. mechanical doors, circuit boxes, etc.
The main objective of the level is to reach the room with the required data, being held somewhere in the level and being protected behind high-security doors. The core loop of the game involves:
Entering the level
Crawling through and about the level understanding the map
If there is an open route to another room, then the player can freely explore the map as they please
If the player is blocked by an interactable object, such as a security door, the player can find a panel that they can interact with, hack the interactable which prompts a small minigame. When the player beats the minigame, the interactable allows the player passage or some added benefit to the level
Repeat the last step for the entire level until the required data room is found
Hack the system and obtain the data
Level ends, start loop over again
A select number of interactable are littered throughout the level, some aiding to reach the end of the level, and some not so much.

Game Elements:
The game operates as an 3D open-world game, with countless explorative possibilities. As well as that, the game environment allows for a nostalgic sense of children’s playhouses like PlayPlace and what not. There is also quite a few lore-related assets scattered throughout the game to highlight the state of the laboratory and the tools used by the scientists in their endeavor to pursue knowledge and to understand this world’s limitations. Additionally, there are a few types of puzzle games kept in store for players to ensure the stimulation of the player throughout the level, in addition to the exploration factor of the game itself.
The controls of the game are specifically adjusted to that of PC players, ensuring maximum comfort in anyone’s playing style. And even though the game is specifically single player, it could undergo adjustments to create an enjoyable multiplayer experience.

Game Assets:
The assets used in the game are mostly created by our team. However we used three assets from unity asset store Keypad Asset, Electrical Box Asset and Electrical Music.
